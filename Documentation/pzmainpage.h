The NeoPZ environment is a object oriented environment for the development finite element simulations.

The NeoPZ environment (in the future quoted as simply NeoPZ) incorporates several advanced finite element
technologies in a single coherent structure, allowing its user to develop sophisticated simulations
in a short period of time.

\section sec_motivation Motivation: Why develop a finite element library?

During my PhD work (late 1980's) I developed hp-adaptive finite element algorithms applied to the
simulation of compressible fluid flow. The first version of the adaptive mesh datastructure dates
back to 1984.

I soon noticed that adaptivity is a universal concept which can be applied to virtually any finite
element simulation. During the time I studied in Texas, adaptivity was applied to the Stokes equations,
to plasticity, to thermal problems, convection problems etc.

On the other hand, It was obvious that writing an hp-adaptive code requires a
major investment. It takes at least two years to write and validate a three dimensional adaptive
finite element code.

At that time I imagined it would be possible to write a finite element framework that would be
allow its user to apply hp-adaptive strategies to different systems of differential equations in 
a single framework.

More recently, the concept of generality has been extended in that the NeoPZ library allows its user 
to choose the approximation space as well. One can approximate a differential equation with continuous
or discontinuous approximation spaces. We are working on incorporating HDiv and HCurl spaces as well.

\section sec_obective Objectives

The objective of the NeoPZ environment is to provide its user access to advanced finite element
technologies within a coherent framework. Wherever possible those technologies should be able
to interact with each other.

What is meant by "advanced technologies" is documented in the section \ref sec_advanced

\section sec_doc_structure Structure of the Documentation
There are many ways to define a library of classes. A global view of the NeoPZ environment is
found in \ref page_structure. This same structure is "more or less" recognized in the

The section \ref page_finite_element_different is dedicated to describing which algorithms within the NeoPZ 
environment are different from regular finite element codes

\page page_finite_element_different - Differences from Regular Finite Element Computations

 \section sec_finite_element_different Differences from Regular Finite Element Computations
NeoPZ integrates zero, one, two and three dimensional simulations into a single finite element library.
It also incorporates non linear geometric maps, hp adaptive meshes and runs a large variety of finite
element simulations. It should therefore come as no surprise that its structure is somewhat different
from textbook finite element structures.

In this section we describe which finite element concepts were modified or extended in the NeoPZ 
environment and how these concepts translated in an object oriented framework

\subsection sec_neighbour Neigbouring Information
Within the geometric mesh, all geometric elements keep track of their neighbours along all the sides 
(see \ref sec_topological) of the element
\subsection sec_jacobian Jacobian Matrix
\subsection sec_topological Topological Concepts associated with an Element
Within NeoPZ a geometric element is considered as the union of open sets of points. 
These sets of points are named sides. As such:
- linear element (pzgeom::TPZGeoLinear) has 3 sides (2 points and one line)
- quadralaterial element (pzgeom::TPZGeoQuad) has 9 sides (4 points 4 lines and one area)
- triangular element (pzgeom::TPZGeoTriangle) has 7 sides (3 points 3 lines and one area)
- hexahedral element (pzgeom::TPZGeoCube) has 27 sides (8 points 12 lines 6 quadrilaterials and one volume)
- prism element (pzgeom::TPZGeoPrism) has 21 sides (6 points 9 lines 2 triangles 3 quadrilaterials and one volume)
- pyramid element (pzgeom::TPZGeoPyramid) has 19 sides (5 points 8 lines 5 triangles and one volume)
- tetrahedral element (pzgeom::TPZGeoTetrahedra) has 15 sides (4 points 6 lines 4 triangles and one volume)
- point element (pzgeom::TPZGeoPoint) has one side: the point itself

All geometries are grouped in the namespace \ref pzgeom. The topology themselves are defined in the namespace \ref pztopology.

Each topology is associated with an area within the dimension associated with the topology. 
For example the one dimensional line element is associated with the line segment \f$]-1,1[\subset R\f$. 
A quadrilateral element is associated with the area \f$]-1,1[\times]-1,1[\subset R^2\f$.
The area associated with a topology is named parameter space. 
In finite element textbooks the parameter space is associated with the space of the master element.
Theoretically each finite element code can define its own parameter space. 
In the NeoPZ environment the parameter space is defined and/or can be modified by specifying other topologies.

Each sides of an element associated with a topology (point, line, quadrilateral, etc). 
The closure of a side (remember that a side is an open set of points) includes its neighbouring topologies. 
For instance the closure of the line includes two point topologies, the closure of a quadrilateral topology 
includes the four lines and four points.

The topology associated with a side of a topology is returned in the method Type(int side). 
This method exists in all classes of the \ref pztopology namespace

The sides included in the closure of a given side are returned in the method LowerDimensionSides. 

As each side has its own parameter space, an affine parameter transformation can be defined between 
the lower dimension sides and the side itself. 
This affine transformation is returned in the SideToSideTransform method

\subsection sec_template_elements Elements based on templates
\subsection sec_matrix Matrix concept as a Linear Transformation
\subsection sec_solver A Matrix inversion procedure as an object
\subsection sec_restraints Shape function restraints
\subsection sec_connect Grouping Multiplier Coefficients in a TPZConnect object
 The TPZConnect class represents multiplier coefficients associated with a set of shape functions.
 When two elements share a vertex, the continuity of the solution is obtained by establishing that the multiplying 
 coeficients associated with all elements which share the node are identical.
 
 Withing PZ, H1 shapefunctions are associated with the sides of the elements (see \ref sec_neighbour). As a consequence a TPZConnect object is created for each
 side of H1 elements. In a discontinuous Galerkin approximation a unique TPZConnect object is associated with each element. In this case no other element
 will be associated with this connect leading a discontinuous approximation.
 
 The TPZConnect object contains information related to the numbering of the global system of equations, the maximum order of the shape functions associated
 with the connect, the number of state variables associated with each connect, the number of shape functions associated with the connect, whether the connect is restrained, whether the connect is associated with a Lagrange
 multiplier and whether the connect has been condensed at the element level.
 
 \subsubsection subsec_sequencenumber Sequence number
 The structure of the global system of equations generated by the finite element approximation is determined by the global equation number associated with each shape function.
 (The set of shape functions determine the approximation space). By modifying the global equation number associated with the shape function, the finite element approximation
 remains the same. The computational effort needed to invert the global system of equations, on the other hand, is strongly dependent on the ordering of the shape functions.
 Within PZ, equations are renumbered by the TPZRenumbering class. The TPZRenumbering class relies on the Boost library (http://www.boost.org ) to optimize the bandwidth and/or fillin
 of the global system of equations.
 
 Rather than associating a global equation number with each shape function, the global equation number are associated with a group of shape functions (which is a TPZConnect object).
 This is why each connect contains a sequence number as the fSequenceNumber variable.
 
 If the TPZConnect object isn't associated with any element, its sequence number will be set to -1. A TPZConnect object with sequence number equal to -1 is called a "free" connect.
 
 \subsubsection subsec_orderofapproximation The order of the shape functions
 Within PZ the maximum polynomial order of the shapefunctions associated with each side of the elements can be choosen independently. The data structure which represents the 
 polynomial order of approximation is the fOrder variable of the TPZConnect object. This variable is of type unsigned char. This means that the order can vary from 0 to 255.
 
 \subsubsection subsec_numberstate The number of state variables associated with each connect
 In finite element approximations of systems of partial differential equations it is customary to associate the same shape function with each state variable. For instance, in two 
 dimensional elasticity each shape function is associated with the horizontal and vertical displacement. In most finite element approximations the number of state variables associated
 with each shapefunction is constant. In these cases the number of state variables can be a value associated with a mesh. In multiphysics problems, the number of state variables can
 vary acording to the physical quantity being represented. For instance, in numerical approximations of flow through porous media, two (or three) state variables are associated with
 the shapefunctions which approximate the displacements of the porous matrix and a single shape function is associated with the pressure variable. This is the reason why each connect
 keeps track of the number of state variables associated with its shape functions
